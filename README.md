# AX-MediaPlayer
Media Playback Engine for Cinder

This is effectively a wrapper around `IMFMediaEngine` (meaning it's currently windows 8+ only). `IMFMediaEngine` supports both a hardware accelerated and CPU implementation and AX-MediaPlayer provides a backend for each. Please refer to the SamplePlayback sample for usage as the method varies slightly due to the synchronisation / locking requirements of the hardware path.

I've taken _reasonable_ care as it pertains to leaks but that is my first COM heavy library
so my first priority was to get it running and make sure it's leak-free later. Please report any
that you find, i've tried to use `ComPtr` et al judiciously so hopefully there's not too many.

I couldn't find any substantial information about thread safety when calling into the `IMFMediaEngine`,
but the audio related functions did _not_ like being called from the main thread, so there's a provided 
way to perform a lambda on the MTA thread which seems to make it happy. `RunSynchronousInMTAThread ( ... )`. 

There's no documentation, please just have a look at the provided sample to see the basic usage. It's all fairly straight forward
video-related stuff. You should be able to just check this out into your cinder install's block's folder and off you go. The sample
is built against cinder 0.9.3 to utilise the built-in imgui debug UI, but should also work with 0.9.2 without the UI

This was just a one night project for fun so it comes with absolutely no warranty. Hopefully it still comes in handy for someone :)
